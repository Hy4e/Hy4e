### SUP! 👋

My name's Sebastian. I was born in 2002, 30th of September.
Here is something you'll find about my projects I currently work on, who I am and what projects I was in in the past and a little about myself.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a RolePlay mulitplayer server in GTA: San Andreas placed in the Liberty City (a city well known from previous series of the game if you played GTA 3.).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything what comes to my mind or what I see I try to accomplish AND as a good example will be a re-created design of Steam Library UI finished today as I'm writing this.

- 💬 Ask me about anything. I don't own any secrets. 👀
- 📫 How to reach me: Via Discord: Hajp#9927
- 😄 Pronouns: Fast typer but less thinker 😅
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first (completed) project reached over 17k lines of code in a single file. 😉
- 🌟 The past: Doesn't matter at all. As I'm an adult now it's time to not think about what was few months or years ago we need to move on and be better for ourselves and for other people. Being young young teenager I did lots of stupids or went over sarcasmic in various situations.
- 🤒 Diseases: Long not healed depression. I'm not ignoring you, I'll respond earlier or later. 🤙
